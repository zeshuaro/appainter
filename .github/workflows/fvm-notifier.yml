            I'm just a reminder to do the following after updating the Flutter SDK version:
            - [ ] Run `flutter pub get` to make sure the dependencies are up-to-date
            - [ ] Update the Flutter SDk version in [HomePage](https://github.com/zeshuaro/appainter/blob/main/lib/home/views/home_page.dart#L19)
